According to Srinivasarao et al. (2015) , the phosphorous level in the sludge between 0 -20 mg/l is considered a phosphorus deficiency; 20 -80 mg/l phosphorus is sufficient, and above 80 mg/l is a high phosphorus level.

Healthy levels of P in soil ranges from 25 to 50 ppm. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln gives the following guidelines to consider when analyzing your P levels in soil: Healthy levels between 25 and 50 ppm should receive light maintenance application of phosphorus annually (1/8-1/4 lb.Dec 15, 2018

Soils are referred to as being acid, neutral, or alkaline, depending on their pH, with 7 being neutral, below 7 acidic and above 7 alkaline. The pH range normally found in soils varies from 3 to 9.Feb 11, 2021

Optimal EC levels in the soil therefore range from 110-570 milliSiemens per meter (mS/m). Too low EC levels indicate low available nutrients, and too high EC levels indicate an excess of nutrients.

What is the normal range of organic carbon in soil?
What is soil organic carbon? | Agriculture and Food
Typically, the organic carbon content of WA dryland agricultural soils is between 0.7% and 4% (Figure 2), although SOC can be as low as 0.3% for desert soils and as high as 14% for intensive dairy soils. Most organic matter is located near the soil surface.Jun 28, 2022

What is the critical limit of Zn in soil?
In field situation, the critical limit of Zn was calculated to be 0.62 mg kg-1 using Cate and Nelson statistical method and gave a predictability value of 53 per cent.Feb 10, 2020

The organic matter content of sands may be less than 1%; loams may have 2% to 3%, and clays from 4% to more than 5%. The strong chemical bonds that develop between organic matter and clay and fine silt protect organic molecules from attack and decomposition by microorganisms and their enzymes. 
When conditions are extremely wet or swampy for a very long period of time, organic (peat or muck) soils develop, with organic matter contents of more than 20%.
